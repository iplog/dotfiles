# My Dotfiles

## Content

You can find a copy of my main dotfiles for:

- vim and macvim
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- git
- ssh

## Installation

Installation has been made easy. Just run :)

    $ git clone git@github.com:iplog/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh

You will be asked for some details in order to generate a custom version of the
.gitconfig file.

All your existing configuration files will be backuped with `.orig` extension. 

The installation has been tested on Mac (10.9) but should work on Linux.
