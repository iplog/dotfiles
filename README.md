## Installation

Installation has been made easy. Just run :)

    $ git clone git@github.com:iplog/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    $ cd ~/.dotfiles
    $ ./install.sh init

You will be asked for some details in order to generate a custom version of the
`.gitconfig` file.

The installation has been tested on Mac (10.14).
